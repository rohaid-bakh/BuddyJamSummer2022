  - "If you\u2019re looking for a quick bite to eat before the big game, I\u2019d
    suggest checking out <b>Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop. It\u2019s smack dab in the middle
    of the map</b>."
  - "<b>2 blocks South and 3 blocks East of the Noodle Shop you\u2019ll find the
    Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart.</b> They have all of your game day essential needs."
  - "I love learning about the history of our city, if you\u2019re interested in
    knowing more, you\u2019ll want to check out <b>Town Hall. It\u2019s located in
    between the Noodle Shop and the Hospital</b>."
  - "When you\u2019re finished shopping, you should head over to the <b>Post Office
    and check things out. It\u2019s directly across the street from the Bee\u2019s
    Knees Mini Mart</b>."
  - "If you\u2019re like me and find yourself in less-than-ideal situations you\u2019ll
    want to know where the <b>Gardenside Hospital</b> is. "
  - "The place is huge, you can\u2019t miss it. <b>It\u2019s over on the Far-West
    side of town, 2 blocks West of Town Hall</b>. "
