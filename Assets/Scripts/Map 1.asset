  - "If you\u2019re new in town and looking for a place to grab a quick bite, <b>Ned\u2019s
    Noodle Shop</b> is perfect.\nYou can\u2019t miss the place, it\u2019s smack dab
    in the <b>middle of the map</b>\r."
  - "The <b>Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart</b>, has anything and everything you could
    possibly need.\nWhen leaving the <b>Noodle Shop, the Mini Mart is just 2 blocks
    down and 3 blocks right</b>."
  - "When you\u2019re finished shopping, you should head over to the <b>Post Office</b>
    and check things out.\nIt\u2019s directly <b>across the street from the Mini
    Mart</b>.\n"
  - "If you\u2019re ever in a bind, you\u2019ll want to head over to the <b>Gardenside
    Hospital. It\u2019s on the far-west side of town, just keep walking from the
    Noodle Shop</b>\n.\r"
  - "<b>In between the Hospital and the Noodle Shop is the Town\u2019s City Hall.
    It's closer to the Noodle Shop than the Hospital though</b>."
