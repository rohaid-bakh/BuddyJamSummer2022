  - "If you\u2019re new in town and looking for a place to grab a quick bite, Ned\u2019s
    Noodle Shop is perfect.\nYou can\u2019t miss the place, it\u2019s smack dab in
    the middle of town.\r\\n"
  - "If noodles aren\u2019t your thing, you can always head over to the Bee\u2019s
    Knees Mini Mart,\n they have anything and everything you could possibly need.\nWhen
    leaving the Noodle Shop, the Mini Mart is just 2 blocks down and 3 blocks over."
  - "When you\u2019re finished shopping, you should head over to the Post Office
    and check things out.\nIt\u2019s directly across the street from the Mini Mart.\n"
  - "If you\u2019re ever in a bind, you\u2019ll want to head over to the Gardenside
    Hospital. It\u2019s on the far-left side of town, just up the road from the Noodle
    Shop.\r\n"
  - "In between the Hospital and the Noodle Shop is the Town\u2019s City Hall. It's
    closer to the Noodle Shop than the Hospital though.\n"
