  - 'Welcome! '
  - 'You are a map maker! '
  - 'You''ll be listening to what customers have to say and be piecing together a
    map for them, it''s that easy! '
  - "Customer instructions won't always be clear, sometimes they'll just make plain
    conversation\u2026 but there's always information to gather regardless. "
  - 'You''ll use that info to drag icons on to their rightful place on the grid map.
    If all things go well, you''ll gain some satisfied customers and be able to move
    on to the next guests. '
  - 'You can try it now. Go ahead and place <b>Ned''s Noodle shop in the middle of
    the map</b> and <b>Bee''s Knees Mini Mart just two blocks west</b> of there. '
  - 'Then place the <b>arcade 3 blocks away from the noodle shop, above the mini
    mart</b>. When you''re done, press <b>finish</b>. If things look good you''ll
    move on to a real customer! '
  - 'Remember, you don''t count diagonally when measuring out blocks, it''s only
    up, down, side to side.  '
