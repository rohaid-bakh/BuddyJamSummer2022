  - 'Welcome to Legend Maker Express and congratulations on your new role as cartographer!

'
  - "In your new position, it\u2019s your responsibility to listen to each of the
    customers. They will provide you with clues as to where each building is located. "
  - 'From their descriptions you should be able to piece together a full functioning
    map of the city.

'
  - "Instructions won\u2019t always be simple and concise. So, you will need to pay
    close attention to each of the customer\u2019s comments.\n"
  - 'Once a customer has provided you with directions, you will drag the location
    icon onto the gridded plane. You will place each of the icons in the area you
    believe the customer was referencing.

'
  - " If successful, you will move on to the next series of maps..\n\nLet\u2019s
    give it a go!\n\n"
  - "Place Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop in the middle of the map.\n"
  - "Now, put the Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart 2 blocks West of the Noodle Shop.\r\n"
  - "Lastly, Rock\u2019s Arcade is 3 blocks away from the Noodle Shop, above the
    Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart.\r\n"
  - Remember, distance will never be measured diagonally, only up, down, and from
    side to side.
