  - "<b>The Gardenside Hospital is across the street from Town Hall</b>. The place
    is massive, you can\u2019t miss it."
  - "If you ever find yourself in need of a pregame munchy you should head over to
    the <b>Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart</b>. There\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll
    have whatever you\u2019re craving. <b>It\u2019s 1 block South and 5 blocks West
    of the Noodle Shop</b>."
  - "<b>On the outskirts of the city, in the Northeastern area you\u2019ll find the
    Post Office</b>. Since you\u2019re new in town you should stop by and chat with
    Miss H. She knows everything there is to know about the town."
  - "<b>As you come into town, just 3 blocks Down from the Post Office you\u2019ll
    pass by Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop</b>. The food is fantastic but the clientele is
    a little peculiar."
  - "Personally, I avoid the place, but if you\u2019re looking for <b>Town Hall you
    can find it close to the center of town, North of the Mini Mart</b>."
  - "You\u2019re going to want to steer clear of that <b>old warehouse. It\u2019s
    just 2 blocks West and 2 blocks South of the Hospital</b>. No seriously, unless
    you want an unplanned trip to the Hospital keep clear of the Hornet\u2019s Nest."
