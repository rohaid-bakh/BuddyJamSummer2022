  - "When I\u2019m not at a Grasshopper\u2019s game I\u2019m usually over at <b>Rock\u2019s
    Arcade and Bowling Alley. My friend\u2019s found this short cut near the lakes.</b>
    Not only is it a shorter route, but also scenic."
  - "After a late night of games and bowling I usually stop by the <b>Bee\u2019s
    Knees Mini Mart. I follow the trail, South from the Arcade</b>."
  - "<b>2 blocks East of the Mini Mart, near the lake\u2019s edge is the Fox\u2019s
    Den Bookstore.</b> Nothing beats a good book and the soothing sound of the water."
  - "<b>In between the Noodle Shop and the Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart is the town\u2019s
    Post Office.</b> You should stop by if you plan on staying for a while."
  - " I\u2019m not much on reading or bowling, but I\u2019m quite the connoisseur
    of fine dining. On the <b>Northwestern side of town, 4 blocks west and 1 block
    south of the arcade is Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop</b>. "
  - "Ned\u2019s a good friend of mine, a bit weird, but a good guy. Tell him I sent
    you and maybe he\u2019ll give you the blue plate special."
