  - The Gardenside Grasshoppers are playing a championship game this weekend; you
    should check it out. My buddies and I will be in the front row. <b>The stadium
    is pretty far North, even further than The Bear Claw Diner</b>.
  - "Before a game I like to stock up on the essentials, well mostly just snacks
    and face paint but the <b>Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart</b> has that and so much
    more. You should definitely check it out. <b>It\u2019s located south of the post
    office across the street from the Bear Claw Diner</b>."
  - " If you plan on staying for a while, you\u2019ll want to check out the <b>Post
    Office</b>. Miss H can get you all set up with a box. <b>It\u2019s 3 blocks away
    from the Stadium, Noodle Shop, Mini Mart, and the Bear Claw Diner</b>."
  - "If you\u2019re looking for a good book, the <b>Fox\u2019s Den Bookstore</b>
    has plenty to choose from. If you find yourself having trouble, let me know and
    I\u2019ll suggest a few. <b>You can find the shop 2 blocks South of Ned\u2019s
    Noodle Shop</b>."
  - "<b>The Hospital is 2 blocks North of the Hornet\u2019s Nest</b>.  If you ever
    find yourself in a sticky situation, you\u2019ll want to head over to the Gardenside
    Hospital. They have great service and even better, they never ask questions."
  - "My man Ned fixes the best noodles in town just <b>3 blocks East of the Hospital</b>.
    You can\u2019t miss the place; <b>it\u2019s sitting in between the Fox\u2019s
    Den Bookstore and the Grasshopper\u2019s Stadium</b>. "
