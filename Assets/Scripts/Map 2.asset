  - The Gardenside Grasshoppers are my favorite team and play every Sunday night.
    My buddies and I never miss a game. Their <b>stadium is located on the Northwest
    side of town</b>.
  - "With the Grasshoppers only playing one day a week, I spend the rest of my time
    hanging out at Rock\u2019s Arcade and Bowling Alley. <b>It\u2019s just 2 blocks
    South and 2 blocks East</b>. "
  - "<b>Just 3 blocks East of the Noodle shop</b> you\u2019ll find the Bear Claw
    Diner. They\u2019re open late and serve the best milkshakes. \r\n"
  - "If you\u2019re new in town, checking out the <b>Post Office</b> is a great way
    to learn about the city. <b>You can find it over on the far Southeast side of
    town</b>."
  - "A lot of the sports fans hang out at Rock\u2019s Arcade and Bowling Alley, but
    it\u2019s much too busy for me. One of my favorite spots is the <b>Fox\u2019s
    Den Bookstore. It\u2019s 2 blocks South of the Arcade</b>."
  - "<b>3 blocks West and 1 block North of the Post Office you\u2019ll find the hornet\u2019s
    nest.</b>The place is abandoned, but I would suggest avoiding the area. \r"
  - "I spend quite a bit of time over at the <b>Hornet\u2019s Nest</b>, but if you\u2019re
    new in town I suggest avoiding the place. If so, <b>you can find it located next
    to the Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart\r</b>."
  - "<b>4 blocks East of the Stadium you\u2019ll spot Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop.</b>
    Ned\u2019s a good pal of mine. In fact, tell him I sent you and he might just
    give you a discount. \r"
  - "<b>The Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Mart</b> has anything and everything you could
    ever need. I make all of my essential purchases at the Mart.<b> It\u2019s South
    of Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop</b>."
