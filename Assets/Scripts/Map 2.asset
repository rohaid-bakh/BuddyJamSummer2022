  - The Gardenside Grasshoppers are my favorite team. Their stadium is located on
    the Northwest side of town.
  - "The Post Office is great if you\u2019re looking to learn more about the town.
    It\u2019s over on the far Southeast side of the town."
  - "If you\u2019re only in town for a short while, you have to stop by the Bear
    Claw Diner, they have the best bagels around. The diner is an equal distance
    from both the Post Office and Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop."
  - "The Hornet\u2019s Nest is an old, abandoned warehouse located next to the Bee\u2019s
    Knees Mini Market.\r\n"
  - " If you\u2019re bored and looking for something to do, you should check out
    Hopper\u2019s arcade and bowling alley. It\u2019s 4 blocks from the stadium."
  - "If you\u2019re leaving the stadium, you should head East for 4 blocks. This
    will bring you to Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop, one of my favorite places in town."
  - "The Bee\u2019s Knees Mini Market has anything and everything you could ever
    need. It\u2019s south of Ned\u2019s Noodle Shop."
  - "If you\u2019re not into bowling or the arcade you can check out the Fox\u2019s
    Den Bookstore. It\u2019s just 2 blocks South of Hopper\u2019s."
  - "I\u2019d suggest avoiding the area, but The Hornet\u2019s Nest is an equal distance
    from both the bowling alley and the Post Office."
