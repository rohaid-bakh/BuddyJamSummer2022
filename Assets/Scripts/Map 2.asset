  - To get acquainted with the town I would suggest stopping over at Town Hall. It's
    located in the middle of town.
  - When it comes to shopping, I only go to the Bee's Knees Mini Mart, they have
    everything. It's 2 blocks south of Town Hall.
  - Just down from the Mini Mart is a place called Ned's Noodles. It's one of my
    favorite spots in town. If you're leaving the Mart, you'll just want to head
    4 blocks right.
  - If you're looking for the Hospital, you'll walk 2 blocks north from the lake.
  - The Post Office is just Northwest of the Town Hall by a block.
